-NCGL Project-
The ncgl project is as provided with the exceptions of editing in/creation of the following files:

	-Mesh.h & Mesh.cpp
		Created by me with use of some of the tutorial code. The LoadMeshFile() implementation is completely different from the ones provided with the previos graphics coursework.
	-Keyboard.h & Keyboard.cpp
		These have had an added function: CurrentlyPressed() which is my creation. The rest of the methods are as provided.
	-Renderer.h & Renderer.cpp
		Largely unique, created with reference to some of the tutorial code.
